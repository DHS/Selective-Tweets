This is the source code for Selective Tweets - an app that enables people that use both Facebook and Twitter
to cross-post Tweets to their Facebook profile or page using the #fb hashtag.

The app can be found at
http://apps.facebook.com/selectivetwitter/

Source code released January 2012 under the MIT licence. You are free to use this code for educational

Requirements
============

Pretty simple:
 - PHP under Linux
 - A web server (I use Apache)
 - MySQL database
 - Cron for scheduling jobs


How it works
============

The app provides a web interface based on the Facebook PHP SDK enabling users logged into Facebook to configure
a Twitter account to watch for tweets. It then collects tweets containing the #fb hashtag using Twitter's
streaming API and stores them in a database-based queue (MySQL). A daemon run every couple of minutes processes
the queue of tweets, matches them against records of Facebook profiles/pages and compiles Facebook Graph API
batch requests to cross-post updates as appropriate.


To get set up
=============

 - edit config/config.php
 - create DB according to config/database_schema.sql
 - make www/ available under a webserver
 - execute cron/check_stream_tracker.php to start tracking the twitter stream
 - run the CLI scripts under cron/ on a regular basis to do the work
